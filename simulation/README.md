# Simulation files for *LTSpice XVII*

Circuit simulation of the simple mixer with CD4066 which is part of my bat detector

* '40666_mixer.asc' contains the simulation circuit
* 'CD4066.asy' contains the symbol file, it has to be copied somewhere inside .../LTspiceXVII/lib/sym e.g. in .../LTspiceXVII/lib/sym/Switches
* 'CD4066.sub' contains the simulation model of the IC, it has to be copied to .../LTspiceXVII/lib/sub
